# Portfolio of Personal Project

## Real-Time Face Analysis for Customer Segmentation

Build Flask web application that utilizes a convolutional deep neural network model to detect faces in real-time webcam feeds from scratch. Upon detection, the application predicts the age, gender, and ethnicity of the individuals, displaying the results alongside the live video stream. The application continuously captures frames, analyzes them, and provides immediate feedback on the identified attributes of the detected faces. The results are automatically sent and analyzed to provide demographical analysis in Excel.

Users can interact with the application by adjusting verification criteria for gender, race, and age, receiving immediate feedback on the accuracy of predictions.
